# 👋 Hi there!

I'm a Master's student in **Automation and Control Engineering** at Politecnico di Milano, with a strong interest in intelligent systems and autonomous agents.

🔍 I’m passionate about:
- Control systems & feedback theory
- Robotics and autonomous navigation
- Multi-agent systems and AI for decision-making

🛠️ I like to build things with:
- `C` / `C++` for performance-critical applications
- `Python` for quick prototyping and data analysis
- `ROS` (Robot Operating System) for integrating robotic systems
- `MATLAB` and `Simulink` for modeling, simulation, and control design 

---

## 🚀 What I'm currently up to

- Exploring motion planning and control for robots
- Working on university projects involving ROS and model predictive control
- Always learning — currently diving deeper into optimization and real-time systems

## 🧠 Interests & Goals

I'm particularly drawn to problems where **math meets machines** — whether it's stabilizing a quadcopter, coordinating swarm robots, or designing smart controllers that adapt to uncertainty.

My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of **autonomous, safe, and intelligent systems** that can operate reliably in the real world.
